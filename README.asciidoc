= BettercallPaul programming challenge

This repository provides the project scaffold for a simple
programming challenge. Though the challenge is very simple
and a rather synthetic use-case, your results are a helpful
starting point to discuss your programming flavor, skills
and methodology.

**BEFORE STARTING:** Please take the time and read this 
document completely and carefully! It describes important 
parts of the challenge.


== Goal

Implement a solution for the given tasks which aims for

* robustness & correctness
* readability & maintainability
* clean software design & architecture

Be prepared to discuss your implementation and software design
decisions. Show us how you would solve the task when working on your day-to-day 
job.

Feel free to come up with own ideas & solutions. There is no plain
"right" or "wrong". Instead, we want to talk to you
about _how_ you achieved your goal and about your thoughts and design
idea and process.

=== Use of coding assistants and AI

The current wave of generative AI can be a powerful tool in the hands of a keen developer. 
Feel free to use your coding assistant of choice when solving this challenge if you so desire.
We're looking forward to hear about your approach.

== Tasks

=== Time estimation
Between ~1.5 hour up to ~4 hours,  +
depending on your previous experience & development environment.

=== Task

Weather::
    In `weather.csv` you'll find the daily weather data of a single month.
    Read the file, then output the day number (column one `Day`) of the day with
    the smallest temperature spread (difference between maximum &
    minimum temperature of the day.)
    The maximum temperature is the second column `MxT`, the minimum
    temperature the third column `MnT`.

Countries::
    `countries.csv` contains a list of data about the 27 countries of the European
    Union.
    Use the columns `Population` and `Area` to compute each country's population
    density. Read the file, then print the name of the country with the highest number
    of people per square kilometre.

Task::
    1. Write a single program which is able to solve the "Weather" challenge.
    2. Then refactor and extend your solution such that it additionally
       supports the Countries challenge.

Process::
* Favour the software design goals described under _<<Goal>>_ over other goals 
  like _performance_ or _feature set_.
* Include unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.


=== Hints

Your solution should focus on **maintainability**, **reusability** and
**readability**. Here are some hints on how you may achieve these goals:

1. The most important aspect is **separation of concerns**. Think about
   the different concerns involved in the task and how they may need to
   change in the future. For example: one concern is reading the file.
   What others components can you think of? Try to design separate,
   concise software components for each concern.

2. Often a quick diagram illustrating the components and their interactions
   can be helpful. If you draw a diagram, feel free to include it in your
   solution.

3. Design **intuitive interfaces** for the components in a way that each
   component can be replaced. For example in the next evolution step
   of your solution you might need to support other data formats like
   JSON files or even Web services. The Reader for the CSV-files in your
   example could be replaced with a reader that implements the same
   interface but reads JSON-files.

4. Use **meaningful names** for classes, properties and methods. By
   reading the name, one should already have an idea of what something
   does.

5. Think about possible **error cases**, e.g. if a file is empty or contains invalid input, and how they should be handled. Use log messages where necessary.

6. You may use additional third-party dependencies as you see fit. Please include your reasoning for your choice of libraries in your solution.

== Getting started

=== Install Java

For this project, the Java Development Kit 11 or above is required. You can download it from https://adoptium.net/.

=== Getting a copy

The starting point for every challenge is provided as a branch in a GitHub
hosted Git repository. Be careful to adjust the URLs below
accordingly.

To start

=== Fork or directly clone the repository

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git clone {url-repo}.git
----

or if you've forked the repository then

```
git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/programming-challenge.git
```

=== Building and running
The project scaffolds provides a Maven `pom.xml` as starting
point. You should be able to start with any IDE or text editor
you are convenient with.

After installing Maven 3.x or by calling the included Maven wrapper (`mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd`, depending on your operating system) you should be able to

Build & test your project::
    `mvn verify`

Then to run the main class _de.bcxp.challenge.App_::
    `mvn exec:java`

To remove the compilation output::
    `mvn clean`

Or use your IDE functionality::
    to run & debug your program.

== Submitting your results

Ideally you provide your solutions as Git repository with
appropriate commits and descriptions. If you have a GitLab.com
or GitHub account, please feel free to publish your solution
there.







= Solution

This section describes the implemented solution, architecture and design decisions.

== Solution Overview

The solution implements both challenges (Weather and Countries) in a single program and follows a layered and extensible design that emphasises:

* separation of concerns
* clear domain modelling
* testability
* robustness against malformed data
* extensibility for future data formats

== Architecture

=== Layers

1. IO Layer:
   - `TableReader` interface
   - `CsvTableReader` implementation
   - `TableReaderFactory` 
   - Responsible only for reading tabular data

2. Domain Layer:
   - `WeatherDay`
   - `Country`
   - Pure data representation

3. Analysis Layer:
   - `WeatherAnalyzer`
   - `CountryAnalyzer`
   - Contains business logic

4. Composition Root:
   - `App`
   - Orchestrates dependencies and execution flow

== Key Design Decisions

=== TableReader Interface
A generic `TableReader` abstraction to decouple file format from business logic.

Benefits::
* Allows easy support for JSON, XML or API-based data sources
* Improves testability
* Follows Dependency Inversion Principle

=== Factory Pattern
`TableReaderFactory` selects the correct reader based on resource path.

Benefits::
* Centralised instantiation logic
* Open for extension without modifying core logic
* Clean separation of creation and usage

=== Country & Weather Separation
Each problem domain has its own:

* Domain model
* Analyzer
* Parsing logic

This increases clarity and reduces unintended coupling.

== Parsing Strategy

Special care was taken to handle real-world data formats, for example european number notation:

[source]
----
4.036.355,00 → 4036355
----

This ensures robustness against localization differences and malformed data.

== Unit Testing Strategy

Core logic is tested independently of file IO using `StringReader`.

[source,java]
----
App.solveWeather(new StringReader(csv), new CsvTableReader(','));
App.solveCountries(new StringReader(csv), new CsvTableReader(';'));
----

This results in:

* Fast execution
* Deterministic results
* No external dependencies

== Running the project

Build & test the project::
mvn verify

Run the main application (de.bcxp.challenge.App)::
mvn exec:java


== Possible Future Improvements

* Add JSONTableReader implementation
* Extract CSV row mapping (and parsing) into dedicated mapper classes (e.g. WeatherRowMapper, CountryRowMapper)
* Introduce a generic Analyzer<T, R> interface for pluggable analysis strategies
* Introduce structured logging using SLF4J instead of System.err
* Add dedicated error messages for malformed numeric values
* Skip invalid rows

== Summary

The solution fulfills all requested objectives by providing:

* a single program solving both tasks
* clean architecture
* extensible design
* well-tested core logic
* future-proof structure
